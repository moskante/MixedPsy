# MixedPsy
The aim of the mixedpsychophysics project is to provide statistical tools (such as R codes, models and tutorials) for the psychophysics community. This project has a special focus on open-source programming language. For the moment, the codes and documentation are restricted to R, tough other open programming languages (such as Julia) might be considered in the future.
