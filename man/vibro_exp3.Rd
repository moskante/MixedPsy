\title{Data from tactile discrimination task - EXP3}
\format{
A data frame with 72 rows and 6 variables:
\describe{
\item{speed}{a numeric vector giving the motion speed in cm/s of the moving surface}
\item{vibration}{a numeric vector giving the vibration frequency in Hz of the masking stimulus. Either 32Hz or
 0 (no vibration - control condition)}
\item{faster}{The proportion of trials in which the comparison stimulus was judged as faster than the reference}
\item{slower}{The proportion of trials in which the comparison stimulus was judged as slower than the reference}
\item{subject}{subject id}
}
}
\source{
Original data were published in Dallmann et al. (2015).

\description{
A dataset containing the response and stimuli from a tactile discrimination task (nine participants). In a
 forced-choice experiment, participants were required to discriminate the motion speed of a moving surface by
 touching it. Simultaneously with the motion stimulus, a 32Hz masking vibration occurred in half of the trials.
